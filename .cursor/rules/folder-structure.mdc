# Folder Structure Guidelines

Follow this directory structure to maintain a modular and scalable codebase:

- `parser/`: Modular logic for unzipping `export.zip` and parsing `export.xml`.
- `analytics/`: Implementation of core algorithms (ACWR, EF, TSB, Sleep Analysis).
- `ui/`: Reusable Streamlit UI components and dashboard layout functions.
- `public/`: Static assets such as images and branding materials used in the UI.
- `utils/`: Common helper functions (date formatting, unit conversions, data validation).
- `data/`: (Optional) Local development samples or processed CSV caches (not for permanent health data).
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for parsing and analytics logic.
- `main.py`: The entry point for the Streamlit application.

## Principles
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep parsing, analysis, and UI logic in their respective directories.
- **Modularity:** Each file should have a single, clear responsibility.
- **Naming:** Use `snake_case` for all Python files and directories.
