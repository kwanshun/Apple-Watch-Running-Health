# Python Docstring Conventions

All Python functions and methods must include a docstring following PEP 257 standards.

## Requirements

- Use triple double quotes (`"""`).
- Summarize the function's purpose in the first line.
- Include sections for Parameters (`Args:`) and Return values (`Returns:`) if applicable.

## Examples

### ✅ GOOD
```python
def calculate_pace(distance_km: float, time_minutes: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculates the running pace in minutes per kilometer.

    Args:
        distance_km: The distance covered in kilometers.
        time_minutes: The total time taken in minutes.

    Returns:
        The pace in minutes per kilometer.
    """
    return time_minutes / distance_km
```

### ❌ BAD
```python
def calculate_pace(distance_km, time_minutes):
    return time_minutes / distance_km
```
