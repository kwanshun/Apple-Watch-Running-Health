# Python Environment Standards

To ensure consistency and avoid conflicts, follow these standards for Python development:

## Virtual Environment
- **Always verify** that the virtual environment (`.venv`) is active before running Python scripts or installing packages.
- If no virtual environment is found, suggest creating one using `python -m venv .venv`.

## Package Management
- **Prefer `python -m pip`** over just `pip` to ensure the correct environment's pip is used.
- **Do not install packages globally.** Always install within the active virtual environment.
- When installing new dependencies, remember to update `requirements.txt`.

## Usage Examples

### Installing a package
```bash
# ✅ GOOD
python -m pip install pandas

# ❌ BAD
pip install pandas
```

### Running a script
```bash
# ✅ GOOD (within active .venv)
python main.py

# ❌ BAD (outside .venv or using global python)
/usr/bin/python3 main.py
```
